# bxms-uxd-sandbox
This is the BxMS user experpience team's project sandbox. It is a central respository for JBoss BPM/BRMS design documents and user interface prototypes. 

## Design contributions
[Get started with SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)

Then refer to the excellent [instructions on Patternfly Design] for details about how to [set up SourceTree](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/Git-Setup) to get a local copy of this repository and then [make a contribution](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/Contribution-Workflow).

To [work on multiple features at once](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-design/wiki/Multiple-Branches), branches can be created to encompass both the design and implementation of a feature.

## Implementation contributions
Developers should first clone the repository.
- `cd` into the directory.
- Run `npm install`.
- Run the server using `gulp`.
The project will automatically open in the browser, and changes will be shown immediately.

## File Structure
Designs are located in subfolders under /design. Supporting graphics are located in /images folders within those folders.

Sandbox designs and prototypes available at [https://srambach.github.io/bxms-uxd-sandbox/](https://srambach.github.io/bxms-uxd-sandbox/)

HTML prototypes are located in /html with less files in /less. CSS will be generated and placed in the /css folder.

Note: The layouts and assets folders are used to style the Github Pages site.
