# KIE UXD Sandbox
This is the Red Hat UXD team's project for JBoss BPM/BRMS design documents and user interface prototypes.

Designs and prototypes are available at [https://kiegroup.github.io/kie-uxd-sandbox/](https://kiegroup.github.io/kie-uxd-sandbox/)

## File Structure
Designs are located in subfolders under /design. Supporting graphics are located in /images folders within those folders.

HTML prototypes are located in /prototype with a folder for each separate prototype. HTML files are at the top level, with less files in /less. CSS will be generated and placed in the /css folder.

Note: The layouts and css folders are used to style the Github Pages site.
