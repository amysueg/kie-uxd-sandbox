# bxms-uxd-sandbox
Sandbox for UXD team to document designs and prototype the front end.

Designs are located in subfolders under /design. Supporting graphics are located in /images folders within those folders.

One main [index.html](/html/index.html) points to all designs and prototypes.

Styling for design pages is in /assets and /layouts, taken from https://github.com/openshift/openshift-origin-design
